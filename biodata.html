        <h2>Background Of My Biodata</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" align="justify">
            My name is <strong>Fatin Nur Zulaika Binti Fairul Nizam </strong>, a 20-year-old Information Management student with a passion for exploring new skills and knowledge. 
            Born at <i>Hospital Putrajaya</i> on<i>25 June 2004</i>, I hail from <i> Banting, Selangor,</i> a quiet and quaint hometown that I would call "boring." 
            To break away from the routine, I often head to the scenic parks of Putrajaya, where jogging clears my mind and keeps me energized.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" align="justify">
            One of the most exciting parts of my studies has been diving into web development. This subject has opened up a creative outlet for me, allowing me to build websites while sharpening my technical skills, a journey I truly enjoy and look forward to mastering.

        <h2>Love for Information Management</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" align="justify" >
            What drew me to study Information Management was my love for understanding systems and organizing information. Also, this field didn’t require mathematics since I don't like mathematics. 
            This choice opened the door to subjects like web development, which has become one of my favorite parts of the journey. I find joy in bringing ideas to life through code.
            Looking ahead, I aspire to pursue a degree in Information Systems or an IT-related field.
