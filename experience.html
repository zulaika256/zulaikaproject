      <h3>Unarmed Combat Training</h3>
    <p>During my diploma studies, I actively participated in unarmed combat training, a comprehensive martial arts 
       and self-defense program. This extracurricular activity focuses on developing physical fitness, self-defense 
       techniques, and mental discipline through various martial arts.

       session enjoyable and engaging. Through these sessions, I developed basic martial arts skills 
       while building lasting friendships.
